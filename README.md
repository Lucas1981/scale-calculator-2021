# scale-calculator-2021

This is a revamp of a 2014 project. All I knew back then was C and jQuery, so please excuse the clumsiness that it might show today. I'll try to refactor out bit by bit all the parts and hopefully turn them into coherent layer-based classes that manage their own state. After that perhaps some turning it into a Vue based version would also make sense, just to get rid of all the jQuery grabbing DOM elements stuff.
